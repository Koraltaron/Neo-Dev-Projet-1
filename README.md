- The form page allows the user to enter its personnal information that are furthermore stored in the local storage prior a potential use (user first name is then displayed on the main page title). Once registered and the submission validated, the user is driven to the main page.
- The main page is the social network pannel. It is a mock page, that allows the user to navigate into the match page. The page comes with a lot of hover effects and media queries to adapt to various screen formats. User can listen a calm sound while being on the main page with the sound button. The latter is unactive by default and can be launch or stop with the button.
